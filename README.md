# react-portfolio

## Description

This app aims to create a portfolio that displays relevant info over a few different pages, using React and React Router to do so. This could be used to give a potential employer quick access to information about you, your project history (including deployed and Github links), your resume, and links to your other relevant coding-related profiles.

Through this project, I learned more about React, React Router, uisng Vite to create the initial files, and using Bootstrap to implement CSS design.

## Installation

Copy the SSH Key from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dcartolano/react-portfolio) and perform a git clone into the directory of your choice. Open in VS Code or similar program. In the terminal, run "git i" to download all relevant node modules.

## Usage

If you only want to navigate to the deployed site, you can view it [here](https://shiny-baklava-8ba7dd.netlify.app).

If you are trying to view the app locally through the terminal, right click on the package.json file in the outermost folder and select "Open in Integrated Terminal", then run the command "npm i" if you haven't already, followed by "npm run build" and finally "npm run start." It may not open in your browser automatically, so use a ctrl-click (for Windows) or a cmd-click (for mac) on the link shown in the terminal to open it in your default browser.


## Credits

Thanks to EdX and Northwestern for the starter code and the opportunity to practice these skills. 

Thanks to my instructor and the EdX tutors for all the help and clarifications along the way.
